getComputerChoice()
    - returns either ROCK, PAPER or SCISSORS 
    - this makes computer's play

playRound(playerSelection, computerSelection)
    - compares the two parameters and returns a string declaring the winner of round 
    - case insensitive

game()
    - keeps the score and reports the winner


How do I map string choices like ROCK to manipulatable values? 
    - Map numbers to the choices, i.e ROCK = 1, PAPER = 2, SCISSORS = 3
    1 beats 3
    2 beats 1
    3 beats 2
